<h2> What is osTicket? </h2>

osTicket is an open-source help desk and ticketing system that efficiently manages customer support. It features ticket management, customizable forms, agent collaboration, automated workflows, a knowledge base, and reporting tools. osTicket supports email integration, multiple languages, and role-based access control, with free and professional support options.
